        <div class="hook-box">
            "Who here has used ChatGPT to help with homework?"<br> "And who has caught ChatGPT making up completely fake information?"<br> "Today, you'll learn why that happens, how to avoid it, and even how to build AI tools that can access real information!"

        <p class="poll-question">Quick Poll: On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your understanding of how AI tools like ChatGPT actually work?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Opening Activity</strong>: Quick poll to gauge students' familiarity with AI tools like ChatGPT.</p>
        <p><strong>Workshop Goals</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand how large language models function</li>
            <li>Learn about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</li>

            Did you know that Microsoft invested $13 billion in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT? That's more than the GDP of many small countries! The race to develop advanced AI is creating entire new industries and job markets.
        </div>

        <h3>How LLMs Work (10 minutes)</h3>
        <div class="hook-box">
            Let's try a game: I'll start a sentence, and you try to predict the next word: "The student opened their textbook and began to..." [Let students guess] This is exactly what LLMs do - but on a massive scale, using patterns from trillions of words!
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Key Concepts</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Next Word Prediction</strong>: Explain that LLMs like ChatGPT are essentially sophisticated next-word prediction systems. They analyze patterns in text to predict what words should come next in a sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>The Prediction Process</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>LLMs calculate probabilities for the next likely words based on the input context</li>
                    <li>Once a word is generated, it becomes part of the new context</li>
                    <li>The model can't go back and change previous words</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Training vs. Fine-tuning</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Base models are trained on vast amounts of text data</li>
                    <li>Models are then fine-tuned with human feedback to follow instructions better</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="fact-box">
            GPT-4, one of the most advanced LLMs, was trained on approximately 13 trillion tokens (word pieces). If printed, this would be about 10 million books - a stack of paper 500 miles high! The computing power used to train it could run all the calculations needed for your math homework for the next 10,000 years.

        </div>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <strong>Quick Challenge:</strong> Think about how an LLM might complete these sentences differently based on context:
            <ol>
                <li>"I went to the bank to..." (deposit money? fish in the river?)</li>
                <li>"The bat flew..." (animal or baseball bat?)</li>
            </ol>
            How does the LLM know which meaning to use?
        </div>

        <h3>RAG Applications (10 minutes)</h3>
        <div class="hook-box">
            Have you ever caught ChatGPT making up a completely fake research paper or statistic? That's called "hallucination," and today you'll learn how major companies solve this problem with a technique called RAG that lets AI access real, verified information.
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Key Concepts</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>What is RAG?</strong>: Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines an LLM with the ability to retrieve information from external knowledge sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Why RAG Matters</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Helps overcome LLM limitations like outdated knowledge</li>
                    <li>Prevents hallucinations (making up false information)</li>
                    <li>Allows access to specific knowledge not in training data</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>RAG Process</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create external data repository</li>
                    <li>Convert data into vector representations</li>
                    <li>Retrieve relevant information based on user query</li>
                    <li>Augment the LLM prompt with retrieved information</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="fact-box">
            When Microsoft integrated RAG into Bing's AI, it reduced hallucinations by 82%. Major companies like Google, Meta, and Apple are racing to build the most accurate RAG systems. The AI that can access and use real-world knowledge most effectively will dominate the market.

        <h3>LangChain Basics (10 minutes)</h3>
        <div class="hook-box">
            Imagine trying to build a car from scratch - designing the engine, transmission, and every component. That would take years! Instead, car manufacturers use pre-built parts. LangChain is like that for AI - a toolkit of pre-built components that lets you create powerful AI applications in minutes instead of months.
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Key Concepts</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>What is LangChain?</strong>: An open-source framework that simplifies building applications with LLMs.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Components</strong>:

                    <li>Provides tools to connect LLMs with external data sources</li>
                    <li>Enables creation of chains of operations</li>
                    <li>Allows for modular development of AI applications</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Why Use LangChain?</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Simplifies complex LLM interactions</li>
                    <li>Provides ready-made components for common tasks</li>

            A high school student named Ethan in California used LangChain to build an AI tutor that answered questions about his school's curriculum.

            <strong>Brain Teaser:</strong> Imagine you have an AI agent with access to:
            <ul>
                <li>A web search tool</li>
                <li>A calculator</li>
                <li>A summarization tool</li>

        <h3>Hands-on Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
        <div class="hook-box">
            Now for the exciting part! You're about to build something that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago - your very own AI agent that can research topics, solve math problems, and answer complex questions. This is the same technology powering systems that companies pay thousands of dollars for!

        <p><strong>Jupyter Notebook Exercise</strong>: Guide students through building a simple AI agent using Python.</p>
        
        <pre><code>
# Sample code for the notebook
import os
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType

# Set up OpenAI API key (use a classroom shared key for the workshop)
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"

# Initialize the language model
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

# Load tools for the agent
tools = load_tools(["wikipedia", "llm-math"], llm=llm)

# Create an agent with the tools and the language model
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, 
    llm, 
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
)

# Test the agent with a question
agent.run("What is the population of India divided by the population of the United States?")

            Companies pay AI engineers with these skills $150,000+ per year as starting salaries. The code you're writing today is similar to what powers enterprise AI assistants used by companies like Walmart, JP Morgan, and Microsoft.
